# CSV Data Analysis Project

### Overview

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) registration data using Python and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. The dataset, sourced from an online repository, includes details about EVs, such as make, model year, electric range, and county-wise registrations. The analysis provides insights into EV distribution, trends, and correlations among different features.

### Features

- Data Exploration: Basic statistics, missing value checks, and dataset structure examination.

- Visualization:

-- Top Electric Vehicle Manufacturers: A bar chart displaying the most popular EV brands, categorized by electric vehicle type.

-- Model Year Distribution: A histogram visualizing the frequency of EV production years.

-- Electric Range Analysis: A boxplot showing the distribution of EV ranges and identifying potential outliers.

-- County-wise EV Registrations: A bar plot representing the top 10 counties with the highest EV registrations.

-- Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap illustrating relationships between numerical variables in the dataset.

### Insights and Observations

- EV Manufacturers: The dataset reveals dominant EV manufacturers, highlighting market leaders.

- Model Year Trends: Most EVs are from recent model years, indicating increasing adoption in recent times.

- Electric Range Distribution: The analysis helps identify typical EV range values and detect extreme variations.

- Geographical Distribution: Some counties have significantly higher EV registrations, possibly due to government policies, charging infrastructure, or local incentives.

- Feature Correlations: The heatmap showcases relationships between different numerical attributes, helping in further predictive analysis.
